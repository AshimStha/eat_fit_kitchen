# Some changes from last time

## Local modules
The Products folder was added with the separate file configurations for the routes and app functions.


## Secured API settings using .env
The dot env file was added to secure the DB host information to be used in the application.

## To run
1. Modify the .env file values to ones which reflect your app settings.
2. Run the command `npm i` to download the node modules.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the local server or can configure to use the MongoDB Atlas service.
